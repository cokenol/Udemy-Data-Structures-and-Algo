// If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// BFS
BFS

// If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// BFS
BFS (DFS will take long)

// If tree is very wide:
// DFS
DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

// If the solutions are frequesnt but located deep in the tree
// DFS
DFS


// Determinng whether a path exists between two nodes:
// DFS
DFS (built for this)

// Finding the shortest path:
// BFS
BFS
